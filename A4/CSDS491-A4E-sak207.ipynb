    "### Exercise 4. Gaussian Mixture Models (25 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "4.1 (10 pts) Use the EM equations for multivariate Gaussian mixture model to write a program that implements the Gaussian Mixture Model to estimates from an ensemble of data the means, covariance matrices, and class probabilities.  Choose reasonable values for your initial values and a reasonable stopping criterion.  Explain your code and the steps of the algorithm.  Do not assume a diagonal or isotropic covariance matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.2 (5 pts) Write code to plot the 3-sigma contours of each Gaussian overlayed on the data (try to find a library function to plot ellipses).  Illustrate with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.3 (5 pts) Define a two-model Gaussian mixture test case, synthesize the data, and verify that your algorithm infers the (approximately) correct values based on training data sampled from the model and plotting the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.4 (5 pts) Apply your model to the Old Faithful dataset (supplied with the assignment files).  Run the algorithm for the cases $K=1$, $K=2$, and $K=3$.  For each case, plot the progression of the solutions at the beginning, middle, and final steps in the learning.  For each your plots (you should have 9 total), you should also print out the corresponding values of the mean, covariance, and class probabilities."

    "| <b> Pedagogical Value </b> | No clear statement of idea or concept being explored or explained; lack of motivating questions. | Simple problem with adequate motivation; still could be a useful addition to an assignment. | Good choice of problem with effective illustrations of concept(s).  Demonstrates a deeper level of understanding. | Problem also illustrates or clarifies common conceptual difficulties or misconceptions. |\n",
    "| <b> Novelty of Ideas </b> | Copies existing problem or makes only a trivial modification; lack of citation(s) for source of inspiration. | Concepts are similar to those covered in the assignment but with some modifications of an existing exericse. | Ideas have clear pedagogical motivation; creates different type of problem or exercise to explore related or foundational concepts more deeply. | Applies a technique or explores concept not covered in the assignment or not discussed at length in lecture. | \n",
    "| <b> Clarity of Explanation </b> | Little or confusing explanation; figures lack labels or useful captions; no explanation of motivations. | Explanations are present, but unclear, unfocused, wordy or contain too much technical detail. | Clear and concise explanations of key ideas and motivations. | Also clear and concise, but includes illustrative figures; could be read and understood by students from a variety of backgrounds. |\n",
    "| <b> Depth of Exploration </b> | Content is obvious or closely imitates assignment problems. | Uses existing problem for different data. | Applies a variation of a technique to solve a problem with an interesting motivation; explores a concept in a series of related problems. | Applies several concepts or techniques; has clear focus of inquiry that is approached from multiple directions.|"
