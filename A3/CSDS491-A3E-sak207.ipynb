    "### Exploration (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in previous assignments, in this exercise you are meant to do creative exploration.  You don't need to write a book chapter, but the intention is for you to go beyond what's been covered above or explore new topic altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "One suggestion: Select a probabilistic programming package and work through and explain in your own words an example of interest to you from the documentation or tutorial.  Many of the simple tutorials will cover models similar to what we have discussed in class.  Be sure your explanation is from your own perspective and understanding; do not simply copy the tutorial.  You should add your ownÂ unique variations and modifications to better present the ideas or other things you found interesting.  The purpose of this exercise is simply to make you aware of some of the modern tools that are available for probabilistic modeling.  There are several packages available to choose from and they are all under active development as this is an active field of research.  In python, popular packages are [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io) and [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability).  In Julia, popular packages are [Gen](https://www.gen.dev) and [Turing](https://turing.ml/stable/).  There are many other choices, so feel free to choose something else if you find it interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can select a topic from the readings (Barber chapters 4, 5, and 27; Murphy chapters 19, 20, and 23; or Bishop Chapter 8) and write your own exercise.  It should aim to teach or explore a concept you don't understand or found interesting.  Like before, you don't do an excessive amount of work.  This isn't a project.  Aim for something worth about 20 points, i.e. about half as much work has exercise 1 but more than exercise 2.  See the rubric below for grading criteria."

    "\n",
    "Exploration problems will be graded according the elements in the table below.  The scores in the column headers indicate the number of points possible for each rubric element (given in the rows).  A score of zero for an element is possible if it is missing entirely.\n",

    "| <b> Pedagogical Value </b> | No clear statement of idea or concept being explored or explained; lack of motivating questions. | Simple problem with adequate motivation; still could be a useful addition to an assignment. | Good choice of problem with effective illustrations of concept(s).  Demonstrates a deeper level of understanding. | Problem also illustrates or clarifies common conceptual difficulties or misconceptions. |\n",
    "| <b> Novelty of Ideas </b> | Copies existing problem or makes only a trivial modification; lack of citation(s) for source of inspiration. | Concepts are similar to those covered in the assignment but with some modifications of an existing exericse. | Ideas have clear pedagogical motivation; creates different type of problem or exercise to explore related or foundational concepts more deeply. | Applies a technique or explores concept not covered in the assignment or not discussed at length in lecture. | \n",
    "| <b> Clarity of Explanation </b> | Little or confusing explanation; figures lack labels or useful captions; no explanation of motivations. | Explanations are present, but unclear, unfocused, wordy or contain too much technical detail. | Clear and concise explanations of key ideas and motivations. | Also clear and concise, but includes illustrative figures; could be read and understood by students from a variety of backgrounds. |\n",
    "| <b> Depth of Exploration </b> | Content is obvious or closely imitates assignment problems. | Uses existing problem for different data. | Applies a variation of a technique to solve a problem with an interesting motivation; explores a concept in a series of related problems. | Applies several concepts or techniques; has clear focus of inquiry that is approached from multiple directions.|"
